    <h1>ðŸŒŠThe Two Seas</h1>
    <p>
        The two seas, of different density, meet but do not mix. Like there was an invisible barrier between the two,
        their
        waters do not mix creating a truly amazing visual effect that seems almost supernatural. Instead the phenomenon
        is
        easily explained by the different density, temperature and salinity. Skagen, Denmark: the two seas that never
        mix
